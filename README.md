# Meds To Go
Meds To Go is a website that allows users to order their prescription medication conveniently from the comfort of their own homes. The user simply has to upload their prescription, choose their pharmacy, and choose if they want pickup or delivery. They also have the option to easily order and request refills. The website keeps track of all of the user's medication information such as past orders, current orders, total cost of medication, and active medications. Our website allows the customer to securely login to their own profile, enter their delivery address, doctor information, health card information, insurance information, and their preferred pharmacy. There are also notification settings to inform the user when their order has been approved by the pharmacy, when their order will be delivered, and also if they need a refill soon.
